# [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019)

Some Rust here.
Most likely not very idiomatic, safe, and performant.
🤷‍♂

## Usage

### Run existing days

#### All days

```sh
make all
```

#### Single day

```sh
make day 1
```

### Create new day

```
make new 2
```

## Install

```sh
make cargo-utils

Or at least: `cargo install cargo-edit`
